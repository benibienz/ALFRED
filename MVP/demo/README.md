Requirements (run `pip install` for the ones you don't have):
flask
numpy
sklearn

To run:
`cd` into MVP directory
`sh launch_demo.sh`
Ctrl + C to stop

I'm currently using two html documents: **base.html and simple.html**
The CSS styles are from UIkit and **static/style.css**
All flask endpoints in **gui.py**
Python backend (similar to demo2.py) in **expert.py**
