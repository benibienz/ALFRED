        This is a simple demo of the A.L.F.R.E.D. system. <br>
        You are presented with information about a series of space objects. <br>
        For each object, decide whether to investigate it or not. <br>
        You can make up your own rule (e.g. only investigate unkown objects. <br>
        ALFRED will try to learn your rule and recommend actions by highlighting them in green.
